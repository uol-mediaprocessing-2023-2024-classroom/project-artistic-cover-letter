Welcome to our project! This guide will help you set up and start the project on your local machine, and also provide you with information on how to access and run our comprehensive documentation.

## Getting Started

This project is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend, with detailed documentation available for our development approaches.

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**: Go to the [backend](/backend) folder. Detailed setup instructions can be found in the backend [README](/backend/README.md).

2. **Install Dependencies**: In the backend directory, install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Start the Backend Server**: Once dependencies are installed, start the backend server.

### Frontend Setup (Flutter)

1. **Install Flutter**: Download and install Flutter from the [official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**: Proceed to the [frontend](/frontend/artistic_cover_letter/) `frontend/artistic_cover_letter/` directory.

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**: Run `flutter pub get` in the terminal within this directory.

4. **Launch in a Web Emulator**: Start the frontend using `flutter run -d chrome`.

### Project Documentation

Our project's journey, including various approaches and the eventual adoption of the YOLOv8 model for image cropping, is comprehensively documented. This documentation is located in the `documentation` folder and is executable in Jupyter Notebook.

#### Running the Documentation in Jupyter Notebook

To explore and run our documentation:

1. **Navigate to the Documentation Folder**: Locate the [documentation](/documentation) folder in the project repository.

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: If you haven't already, install Jupyter Notebook. You can find instructions on the [official Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal or command prompt.

4. **Run the Documentation Notebooks**: Once Jupyter Notebook is open, navigate to the `documentation` folder and open the `.ipynb` files. You can run each cell in the notebook to see the code in action and understand the development process, including the implementation of the YOLOv8 model.
